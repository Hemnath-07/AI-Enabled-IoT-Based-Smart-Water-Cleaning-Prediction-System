# 💧 AI-Enabled IoT Based Smart Water Cleaning Prediction System

Clean water is essential for public health and safety. Traditional water quality monitoring methods rely on manual testing and reactive maintenance, which can lead to delayed cleaning and potential health risks. This project presents an intelligent solution that combines IoT and Machine Learning to predict **month-wise water cleaning requirements** and classify them as **High, Moderate, or Low**.

---

## 🎯 Project Aim

The main aim of this project is to **predict the month in which the water source requires cleaning** and determine the **cleaning priority level (High / Moderate / Low)** using historical water quality data and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Project Description

The system analyzes water quality parameters collected from sensors or datasets such as pH, turbidity, solids, and conductivity. When a dataset is uploaded through the web interface, the system processes the data, calculates monthly averages, and uses a trained machine learning model to predict the cleaning requirement for the current month.

This predictive approach helps in **preventive maintenance**, reduces water contamination risks, and improves decision-making for water management authorities.

## 🔁 System Workflow

1. Water quality data is collected using IoT sensors or uploaded as a CSV file  
2. Data is preprocessed and missing values are handled  
3. Monthly water quality trends are analyzed  
4. A Machine Learning model predicts the cleaning level  
5. The result is displayed as **High, Moderate, or Low cleaning requirement**
